        Introduction
        ============
        
        This project aims to be a simple USB/HID user application space (hence no system 
        drivers needed) 100% python package (without C extensions). Initially targeting 
        simple HID devices management.
        
        The vision for this project is to be something similar to `PySerial` or `PyParallel` 
        but for USB/HID hardware enthusiasts.
        
        Advantages
        ----------
        
         * All python code, using ctypes
         
         * Top level handling of HID events (usage events calling hook function handlers)
        
        Current limitations
        -------------------
        
        Depending on your application you might find these limitations
        
         * Windows only (so far...)
         
         * Maybe speed. I've had feedback by some users that speed is not a problem for high data throughput, but I think you might hit some Python limits if you are require any real time processing.
        
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        Windows
        -------
        
        The most convenient way of installing is using `easy_install` or `pip`, I
        recommend to do this once you are familiar with the library as you might loose
        track of the example source files, but you can take a look to the example or
        the source browsing the github repository.
        
        If using a source package (.zip) from PyPi un-zip your file, or get the source
        from the main repository and run the familiar `setup.py install` command line
        is sufficient, setuptools or distribute (for python 3) are required.
        
        
        Other
        -----
        
        So far only Windows OS it's supported.
        
        Using pywinusb.hid
        ==================
        
        View the `./examples` directory for some (ok, few right now) scripts. These
        show, for instance, how to use pywinusb.hid to handle events from HID class
        devices usages events.
        
        Latest code and some Wiki information can be found on the `main project code page`_.

        Utilities
        ---------
        
        More on this later... 
        
         * The module pywinusb.hid.tools contains a function to check HID class devices
           capabilities, for now it provides a basic human readable text report (see
           the hid.core package, run it as main while HID class devices are connected
           to your system)
        
        Feedback and Contributing
        =========================
        
        Feel free to contact me! use the `main code project page`_, just tell what do
        you think about the project or bring me anything you think might be cool to
        consider.
        
        Any participation it's appreciated, feel free to contribute more examples or applications or just a reference to your open source project that uses the library.
